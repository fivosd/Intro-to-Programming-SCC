The Norwegian government recently greenlit a new copper mine in the northernmost area of the country. The copper mine is set to have its tailings dumped into the Arctic ocean through the neighbouring fjord. The mine will be dumping a total of 2 million tons of tailings per year. "Dumping of mining waste will kill every living thing on the ocean floor," said Lundberg, the head of the Norwegian branch of Friends of the Earth. According to a 2017-World-Bank report, the demand for copper will increase by as much as 50% over the next 20 years. This is due to the use of copper in the production of electric cars and renewable energy sources. According to the Norwegian Trade and Industry Minister, Røe Isaksen, the mine “is needed for the green shift to tackle climate changes." The President of the Norwegian Sami Parliament stated that this project will further strain the local raindeer population and the fjords aquatic ecosystem.
