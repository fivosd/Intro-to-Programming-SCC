# Introduction to Programming with Python

> Fivos, SOAS Coding Club, Term 1, 2019-20

-----------------------------------------------

## Overview

> [!WARNING]
> This course took place between November and January 2019-20, it was expected that additional classes would be held.
> This was not deemed possible due to the outbreak of COVID-19.
> Only 5 of the 10 classes took place.

This course was held at the [School of Oriental and African Studies (SOAS)](https://www.soas.ac.uk/) in London in late 
2019 as part of the SOAS Coding Club.
The goal of the course is to fast-track beginners into programming while providing varied context on possible projects 
as well as the logic skills required. 
Unlike later classes,
it merely seeks to introduce students to programming concepts and how to code simple stuff and solve
common daily problems (e.g. email personalization).

### Course Content Board

The total course exceeds 10 hours in content (for a beginner) broken down into roughly 4 hours of lectures and 6 hours
of self-study, 1 hour of which is set up and 2 hours the Winter Project. 
The exercise sets and project were not mandatory for students but enabled them to challenge themselves on relevant
additional content.

### Learning Outcomes

* Understand what Programming is used for.
* Learn about the basic functionality of Python such as variables, syntax, flow controls, and more.
* Become accustomed to the underlying logic behind common programming problems.
* Implement Search Algorithms.
* Build a simple contact book application using lists and dictionaries.
* Learn how to work with strings and characters, potentially write a Caesar Cipher program.
* Build one of three varied scale full projects, such as inline calculator, save-state contact book, or Caesar Cipher
decrypter.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Week 0: Introduction

This is a preparation week when students are provided with two introductory documents to read. They are also tasked with
installing Python (3.8.x. at the time), as well as Anaconda.

* **What is Programming?**
* **Installing Python**


## Week 1: Variables & Syntax

The content of the first week seeks to familiarize beginners with core concepts such as variables, general syntax, logic
 gates, and more. 
There are lecture slides available that have the following exercises dispersed within them:

* **Addition:** Adding two numbers using `input()` and printing the sum.
* **Compare:** Checking the relationship (larger, smaller, equal), between two numbers.

There is also an available exercise set, with answers attached in _page 2_. Unlike other exercise sets this one has no
coding exercises, just logic and type-understanding questions.

## Week 2: Flow Controls & Loops

The content of the second week seeks to introduce beginners to flow control logic enabling them to create more complex
solutions and programs. 
There are lecture slides available that have the following exercises dispersed within them:
* **Divide by 0 Check:** Using `if` to catch a divide by zero error.
* **Print Sum:** Using `for` to print the sum of numbers from 0 to 100. 
* **Linear Search:** Use both `for` & `if` to search for a value in an array.
* **Fibonacci Number printing:** Create a program which prints up to `n` Fibonacci numbers.  

There is also an available exercise set, the following exercises and answers are included:
* **Binary Search:** A search algorithm which improves search time.
* **Bubble Sort:** Learn your first sorting algorithm. 

## Week 3: Arrays, Lists, and Dictionaries

The content of the third week seeks to familiarize students with structures such as Arrays, as well as introducing them to
dictionaries and lists.
There are lecture slides available that have the following exercises dispersed within them:
* **Improved Linear Search:** Improve your Linear Search w. Type Catching.
* **Infinite Add-List:** Adding items to a list via user input and keep it open using a `for` loop.
* **Removing the worst performers:** Sort and remove value from an array. 
* **Basic Database:** Create a basic 2-row database using linked lists.
* **Basic Phone Book:** Create a simple phone-lookup book using `dict`.
* **Advanced Phone Book:** Create an advanced phone book with four functions.

There is also an available exercise set, the following exercises and answers are included:
* **Say When:** Filling an array up to user input `n` with a specified arithmetic series.
* **The One That Doesn't Fit:** Remove items of a different type from an array.
* **Array Translation:** Remap an array using a dictionary.
* **We don't like john:** Remove values in linked arrays using lookups. 

## Week 4: Strings, Characters, and Files

The content of the fourth week seeks to introduce students to strings, characters, and files, providing context for 
important use cases with text-data, which is common in humanity fields like those taught at SOAS.  
There are lecture slides available that have the following exercises dispersed within them:
* **Personalized Emails:** Alternate a string automatically to personalize an email greeting and save the file.
* **List of Words:** Get all words used (not unique) included in a text blurb.
* **Extract from .txt:** Read a .txt file and extract a string property using regex. 
* **Caesar Cipher:** Encrypt text using simple mathematics and save the encrypted file. 

There was no exercise set this week as [Winter Break Projects](#winter-break-projects) were provided instead. 

## Winter Break Projects

For the winter break (after which no classes were held), students were provided with three projects which can be found,
including resources in the relevant .pdf file. 
* **In Line Calculator:** A simple calculator which can understand e.g. ("2+2") as a string input and return the result.
* **Savable Phone Book:** Take the Phone Book project from Week 3 to the next level by storing the data in files.
* **Frequency Analysis on Caesar Cipher:** Decode the Caesar Cipher from Week 4 using brute force and statistics. 

## Acknowledgments
I would like to thank those who gave me this great opportunity to teach programming by trusting a very young me.
Specifically, I'd like to acknowledge the previous SOAS Coding Club "president"
who now has moved on to this amazing project.
Go give them a follow
if you are interested in hearing about how technology is shaping life and culture in the Global South.
